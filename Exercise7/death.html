   <h2>death</h2>
  <p>
  Alan Turing's death is considered a controversial subject. His death is
  widely considered to had been caused by suicide by cyanide poisoning.
  His housekeeper found him dead at the age of 41. Other people have suggested
  that it was not intended suicide but he accidentaly inhaled cyanide during a
  sceience experiment. His death caused a spark of conspiracy theories around
  the country. <br>
  Before his death Turing was convicted. 
  In 1952, Turing reported a burglary to the police, where it emerged that the perpetrator Arnold Murray was in a sexual relationship with him. As a result of anti-homosexuality laws in the UK in the 1950s, Alan was charged with gross indecency (overturned in 2013). He avoided prison by accepting chemical castration, which eventually left him impotent.
  Turing's security clearance was also removed and he was barred from continuing his work with cryptography at the GCHQ.
  <br> Many  sources have speculated that his suicide was a result of the
  ongoing depression those events caused him.
